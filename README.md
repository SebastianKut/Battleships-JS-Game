Classic Battleships Game wriiten in Vanila JS. The game utilises Animate CSS library for some simple animations. For better UX and playability some sounds have been added.
Below is the list of bugs that have been fixed  throughout the development process.

## Bugs fixed:
- dropping ships in vertical position over bottom edge improperly (ships were getting cut in half and not dissapearing from the ships display)
- dropping ships on top of eachother,
- ability to click multliple times during players turn
- dropping ships on the grid is precise now
- dragged ship last square index number when ship was in vertical position was calculated wrong, causing JS error
- clicking the square already clicked gives turn to CPU
- ability to start the game before setting up players ships
## Features to be added:
- multiplayer mode
